# titanic-data-engineering

This is an end-to-end **Data Engineering and Preprocessing Project** using the famous **Titanic Dataset**. The main objective is to prepare and transform the data so that it's clean, consistent, and analysis-ready for downstream tasks such as machine learning or business intelligence.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Load and inspect Titanic dataset
- Identify and handle missing values
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Prepare cleaned data for further use (EDA, modeling, BI dashboards)
- Version the project with Git and upload to GitHub

## 📂 Files Included

| File Name           | Description                                     |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `train.csv`         | Original training dataset from Titanic dataset  |
| `train_cleaned.csv` | Cleaned dataset after handling missing values   |
| `titanic_cleaning.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step cleaning process |

---

## 🔍 Data Cleaning Process

- Handled missing values in `Age` using median
- Filled missing `Embarked` values with mode
- Dropped the `Cabin` column due to excessive missing values
- Ensured no remaining null values
- Saved the cleaned dataset for future processing

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

---

## 📈 Future Scope

This project is a work in progress and will be extended with:

- ✅ Feature Engineering (like Title extraction, Family size)
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (using Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- ✅ Model Building (Classification algorithms)
- ✅ Visualization Dashboards (Tableau / Power BI)
- ✅ SQL Analysis (if exported to relational DB)
